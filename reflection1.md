Why is reflection important?
Reflecting is quite theraputic and helps you work more productively in future.

What did I do well this week?
I got very blocked this week using the command line and creating my website. I got pretty frustrated and felt quite isolated. But I got through it and the end and figured it out and I guess a feel a bit proud of myself for making it through.

What could I have done to improve?

I could have talked with others more. I find it difficult to reach out for help and I need to work on this
